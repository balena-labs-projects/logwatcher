	A 128-bit message identifier ID for recognizing certain message types, if this is desirable. This should contain a

	// kernel
	// for those read from the kernel
	_TRANSPORT?: string;

	// 	Only applies to "_TRANSPORT=stdout" records: specifies a randomized 128bit ID assigned to the stream connection when it was first created. This ID is useful to reconstruct individual log streams from the log records: all log records carrying the same stream ID originate from the same stream.
	_STREAM_ID?: string;

	// 	Only applies to "_TRANSPORT=stdout" records: indicates that the log message in the standard output/error stream was not terminated with a normal newline character ("\n", i.e. ASCII 10). Specifically, when set this field is one of nul (in case the line was terminated by a NUL byte), line-max (in case the maximum log line length was reached, as configured with LineMax= in journald.conf(5)), eof (if this was the last log record of a stream and the stream ended without a final newline character), or pid-change (if the process which generated the log output changed in the middle of a line). Note that this record is not generated when a normal newline character was used for marking the log line end.
	_LINE_BREAK?: string;

	// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Kernel Journal Fields
	// Kernel fields are fields that are used by messages originating in the kernel and stored in the journal.
	// The kernel device name. If the entry is associated to a block device, contains the major and minor numbers of the device node, separated by ":" and prefixed by "b". Similarly for character devices, but prefixed by "c". For network devices, this is the interface index prefixed by "n". For all other devices, this is the subsystem name prefixed by "+", followed by ":", followed by the kernel device name.
	_KERNEL_DEVICE?: string;

	// The kernel subsystem name.
	_KERNEL_SUBSYSTEM?: string;

	// The kernel device name as it shows up in the device tree below /sys/.
	_UDEV_SYSNAME?: string;

	// The device node path of this device in /dev/.
	_UDEV_DEVNODE?: string;

	// Additional symlink names pointing to the device node in /dev/. This field is frequently set more than once per entry.
	_UDEV_DEVLINK?: string;

	// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Fields to log on behalf of a different programÂ¶
	// TBD, not copied from https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html
	// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Address Fields
	// During serialization into external formats, such as the Journal Export Format or the Journal JSON Format, the addresses of journal entries are serialized into fields prefixed with double underscores. Note that these are not proper fields when stored in the journal but for addressing metadata of entries. They cannot be written as part of structured log entries via calls such as sd_journal_send(3). They may also not be used as matches for sd_journal_add_match(3).
	// The cursor for the entry. A cursor is an opaque text string that uniquely describes the position of an entry in the journal and is portable across machines, platforms and journal files.
	__CURSOR?: string;

	// The wallclock time (CLOCK_REALTIME) at the point in time the entry was received by the journal, in microseconds since the epoch UTC, formatted as a decimal string. This has different properties from "_SOURCE_REALTIME_TIMESTAMP=", as it is usually a bit later but more likely to be monotonic.
	__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP?: string;

	// The monotonic time (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) at the point in time the entry was received by the journal in microseconds, formatted as a decimal string. To be useful as an address for the entry, this should be combined with the boot ID in "_BOOT_ID=".
	__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP?: string;
