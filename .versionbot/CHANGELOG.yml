    - subject: Add debug mode
- commits:
    - body: |-
        Should only output debug logs if the developer
        explicitly wants them as they are noisy. Many
        node developers will have NODE_ENV=development
        when developing with Livepush, meaning we shouldn't
        use that to decide if we should output logwatcher
        debug logs as the developer probably doesn't want
        them always on during development.
